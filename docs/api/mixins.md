# Mixins

Feature mixins used internally by pyclif's group and context classes. Exposed publicly
for advanced subclassing.

## GlobalOptionsMixin

Propagates options marked `is_global=True` from a parent group to all child commands
and subgroups at invocation time.

::: pyclif.GlobalOptionsMixin

## HandleResponseMixin

Auto-wraps commands added via `command()` or `add_command()` with `returns_response`
when `handle_response=True`.

::: pyclif.HandleResponseMixin

## OutputFormatMixin

Dispatches `Response` objects to the appropriate formatter (JSON / YAML / Table / Rich / Raw)
based on `--output-format` stored in `ctx.meta`.
